//here for reference

exp progress bar need to increase based on the percentage of exp earned till next lvl

examples:

0/10=0%
1/10=10%

easy enough on a small scale, but i need it to be dynamic for each time the lvl increases and exp needed increases

250/10,000=2.5% // but how do i code it where this is the same function as 1/10 to check the percentage
10,000 divided by 100=1,000 //which is 1 percent


//this is the answer i have calculated should work

0.025*expBar.width= this.value // this.value would be the amount of width of the exp bar

(currentExp/neededExp)*expBar.width




//current projects 

want to have multiple buttons for different types of upgrades 

upgrades:
        money earned //done
        speed //done
        type of coin earned //progress
        
        upgrade cost reduction // maybe this one could be difficult


want to have some kind of dropdown for changing options in game area

button clicker || some kind of click the game area for income that can be upgraded, earn 2nd || 3rd type of coin


// not before presentation
money printer || some kind of background income that can be upgraded with the 3rd || 4th type of coin
